        <p><b>Margaret Hamilton</b> is a computer programmer who played a key role in helping NASA land astronauts on the Moon. She led a team at MIT that created the software for the Apollo space missions. <b>To write the programs, they used punch cards</b> (cards with holes punched in them to represent computer instructions) and carefully tested every line of code to make sure it worked perfectly. This software made sure the spacecraft could navigate, land on the Moon, and return to Earth safely.</p>

        <h2>Hamilton's work during Apollo 11</h2>
        <p>During the <b>Apollo 11</b> mission, just as the astronauts were about to land on the Moon, the computer started showing error messages. <b>Thanks to Margaretâ€™s work, the system knew to focus on the most important tasks</b> and ignore the less critical ones. This allowed the mission to continue, and the astronauts were able to land successfully. Her work was important not just for Apollo, but also for how we build and use software today.</p>

        <h2>Hamilton's impact on developers</h2>
        <p>Margaret Hamilton inspires software engineers by showing how careful planning and problem-solving can achieve great things. <b>She helped make software engineering a respected field</b> and proved that innovation and persistence can turn big ideas into reality.</p>
